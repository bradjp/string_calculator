Incremental kata

It’s an incremental kata to simulate a real business situation: start off by reading section 1 and completing it, then go onto section 2, and when you have finished that, look at section 3, etc.

Step 1

Create a simple String calculator with a method signature:

    int Add(string numbers)

The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum.

For example “” or “1” or “1,2” as inputs.

For an empty string it will return 0.
